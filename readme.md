# Gym Tracker 
This is a project im using to track my weight training progress. I've noticed that I tend to look at my previous session as a guide on what to do in my current session, but I don't really look that far back and that makes it hard to implement progressive overload. 

### Goals
For me to consider this a complete project theres a few features that need to be present:
- Data needs to be capable of being stored, retrieved, and manipulated.
- Sessions need to be output in a legible and clear format.
- Logging must work. 

### Ideals 
The goals are pretty achieveable, but the ideals will be very dificult for ME to achieve, but it is possible.

- I want a working gui with a working calender and ui. 
- I want some sort of cloud storage connectivity. 
- Theres more but these are the basics.
